## **IELTS Listening Test**

### **Listening has some Major Issues** `(to me)`:
**`You have to`** -
- understand the words, tense and meaning
- focus on the question and the possible word(s) or option(s)
- write the word(s) with correct spelling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`all at the same time.`
- also, the intervals between answers are not equal

**`What our limitations are`** -
- we cannot pay attention to different things at the same time.
- we cannot understand all the words they pronounce (the worst part is when the word we donâ€™t understand is the answer).
- when we cannot find an answer for an unusually long time, we panic, which affects the following questions.

**But we have Hopes:**
- most of the words and sentence structures will be familiar.
- answers will come sequentially.
- the sentences containing the answer word(s) will be grammatically correct, so we can verify our answers.

### **My performance so far:**
- confident on Part-01 and Part-04 (writing words) - (6+8, 9+9, 6+4, 7+9)
- **facing trouble** on Part-02 and Part-03 (choosing letters) - (8+6, 8+7, 5+3, 8+6)

### **Advise from Lilie:**
- listening test at a time also a reading test. because those who are better at reading can finish the reading of the questions and also those who are good at recognizing what is expected in the question have a greater chance of having better marks.
- in part-2 and part-3 (multiple choice questions), there are lots of information to read, we have to read the questions and options as well. Not knowing the questions and options very well leads us to wrong answers. For this, she always try to read the questions in part 2 & 3 twice. **How she does so!** -
    - when the listening test stars, some instructions is provided for couple of seconds before started part-1. By this time, she reads some the part-2 questions as well as the options, because part-1 is easier to her.
    - she advices - while practicing at home we need to experiment and find a reading pace that works for us, we need to train ourselves to read faster, we also need to train our memory, try remembering the information while reading, practice it more and more, practice makes improvements.
    - as soom as the instructor says - you have some time to read the questions 1-7, she return to part 1. Before going to the answer spot, the talk in part-1 also have some contexts, during this time she goes through the questions 1-7. She only focus on the blocks of answer to utilize the time.
    - as soom as she completes part-1, before ending of the talk, she immediately move to part-3, and start reading the questions and options, and follow the same as part-1, and whenever she hears- now you have some time to read questions 11-15, she moves to part-2, by this time she already has read some of the part-3 questions.
    - while listening, we basically try to find the answer instead of focusing what the speaker is saying.
    - she used to hear [Russell Brunson](https://www.youtube.com/@russellbrunson) a lot which helps her listening. Listening to difficult topics and natiove speakers who speak fast helped her improve her listening skills a lot.
    - besides practicing ielts previous test, she also listened to a lot of podcasts, specially news podcasts, also she improved her reading skills. she trained herself to read fast and remember information better. 

### **4 Sections - 40 Questions - 40 minutes `(30 minutes to hear audio + 10 minutes ot transfer answers)`**

### **Tips:**
- you hear the recording only once (we have to write the answer while listening, it could be little hard)
- write the answers either in CAPITAL LETTERS or in lower letters, you have to strict in one for all answers. (If use lower letters - still use Capital first letter for names, places).
- numbers of words for each answer: `No more than two words and/or a number` - one word / one number / two words / two words and a number
- all words and numbers are counted - a holiday (two words)
- spelling is important, misspelled words are wrong answers
- question types:
    - multiple choice
    - map completion
    - diagram labelling
    - form completion (common in section 1)
    - note completion (common in section 4)
    - flow chart completion
    - setence completion (very common)
    - summary completion
    - short answer questions
    - table completion
- don't try to understand everything, aim is to find answer
- prepare the questions and answers
- answers can come quickly, means - they don't follow equal intervals
- keep your eye on the next question
- make notes - since the questions could be large and you might forget them, write them shortly in note.
- there may be a gap between answers - it might the answer is comming later than usual.
- comman traps:
    - answer that are changed (seems like it is the answer but changed afterwards, so keep listening)
    - using similar words in question and recording rather their paraphrases, because ielts usually uses paraphases.
- repeated answers (usually in section 3, multiple speakers may repeat the answers)
- listen for plurals (most of the non-english speaker struggles to iderntify plurals)
- if you don't know the answer, guess and write an answer, don't leave empty
- Remember:
    - listen to the example given at the beginning
    - a range of accents will be used
    - look for titles (diagrams, maps, tables)
    - check where all the questions are
    - if you miss an answer, move quickly to the next one
    - accademic language in not always paraphrased (if you have any hard word it might not be useful)
- have to write words you hear, can't reform words
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Recording** > Children must be accompanied by an adult at all times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Question**&nbsp;&nbsp; > No children are allowed without ........ .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > an accompanying adult / an adult
- make sure your headphone is working properly, concentrate
