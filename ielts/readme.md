## **IELTS Details**

### **Parts of IELTS Test**
1. **Reading**
2. **Listening**
3. **Writing**
4. **Speaking**

### **Know the Test Well**
- Know the inside patterns of the parts (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking)
- Know the marks distribution - which sub-part contains how much marks
- Band score vs raw score - ?/9 : ?/40
- Know the question patterns of the parts - what types of questions will be given and how the marks will be distributed
- For Example - for speaking the marks are distributed on 4 things:
	1. Fluency and Coherence: Fluency is can I talk without having long pause and buzz words and Coherence is the relation between the sentences - are they related or we just jumps here and there.
	2. Grammatical Range and Accuracy
	3. Pronunciation
	4. Lexical Resource - Vocabulary
- Find out the strong and weak points and work on those
- Practice, practice, practice
