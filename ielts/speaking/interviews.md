#### **Part-1:**
**How often do you listen to music?**
**>** I think I listen to music mostly when I'm driving. I think it puts me in such a good mood when I'm out there on a drive and I play my favourite music. I'm usually into Afro music a lot, hip hop and Afro and RnB. So ... I prefer listening to music when I'm driving or something when I'm working out, I'm at the gym, something like that.

**Is music an important subject in schools in your country?**
**>** It is because I'm from India. So .. In India, music and dance and expressing out emotions is usually through music and dancing, So .. In every school, they teach classical music or they have a subject where there is something about music, usually. So I think it is important.

**Do you ever go to live concerts?**
**>**  Oo. I have been to three concerts, and three of them are my favourite artists. And it was actually on my with list, and I made it happen. And it was one of my best experiences. And in live concerts, it's a lot different than you would imagine. You just have to keep your energy straight. And it's like you can't believe it's happening.

**Do you prefer to read magazines or newspaper?**
**>** Definitely, magazines, mostly on the topics of fashion or interior design. This is what I really like because I like to see creative sides from all over the world. I like to see what people are talking about, what's new, what's trending. And I like to learn. And I like to have knowledge of things of like, what is this called, what is that called? Cause usually when you see pictures you don't usually know what it's called. So when you read a magazine or where you get the knowledge, that's where you get to know - Oh, this fabric is called this, or this decoration is called that. So, I think it's very good on information.

**Do you think you can learn as much from a magazine as a book?**
**>** Definitely not, because a magazine is like a shorter version of what's in a book. So I definitely prefer books over magazines.

**Do you think that you will continue to read paper-based magazines in the future?**
**>** I think I'm very old-fashioned like that. I need to have a physical book in my hand, and that's how I think it produces serotonin in my brain. Otherwise, no. Digital, it's very different. I like physically reading a magazine or a book.

**Do you like being outdoors?**
**>** I love being outdoors. I usually spend my time planning an activity or just being out with my friends. Even if I'm not doing anything, I must stay outdoors. I'm not a very home-based person. Like I can't stay home much. I have to keep moving all the time.

**Which outdoor sports do you enjoy doing?**
**>** I like going out with my friends and playing football or some kind of activity like swimming, going to the beach, this is something I really, really enjoy.

**Which outdoor activities are most popular in your society?**
**>** Definitely, it's like the game of India. Everybody loves cricket. When you go out of your house, you're always going to see some kids playing, or also badminton, actually. People enjoy that a lot as well.
