### **What we need to do in Writimg Task 2**
#### **Our goal is** - to clearly answer the question, in a logical way, using appropriate language.
#### **How to do so?**
**1. Thinking**<br>
**> Understand the Question Clearly:** Take sometime and think about what they are actually asking to do.
**> Generate Relevant Ideas:** How you wish to contruct your essay in a very logical way. What you want to include in these essays so that it makes sense, easy to read and understand.<br>
**2. Planning**<br>
**> Inset Ideas into Structure:** Which helps us answer the question in a logical way. The structure could be -
* **Introduction:**
    * Paraphrase the question. A better paraphrasing shows that you have clearly understood the question.
    * Then briefly answer the question in a logical way.
* **Main Body:** Usually contain two main body paragraphs. These paragraphs includes -
    * The topic sentence - which is the main idea of the paragraph
    * Explain - how does the idea answer the question (go into detail here)
    * Putting an example - helps the examiner to understand that you have understood the question very clearly and you have logically answer the question.
* **Conclusion:** Summarize out main points

### **Remember:**
- Only use language that helps you clearly answer the question. `Do not use language you are not comfortable using and don't use memorized sentences that are not related to the actual question.`
- Language should be - accurate (few mistakes possible), appropriate (topic specific words)
- Only use language that you already know how to use. Prefer using simplier language that you fully understand than using some high level words and grammatical structures that you don't sure about.

### **Example of Band Score 9**
**Question:**<br>
Some parents think that childcare centres provide the best services for children of pre-school age. Other working parents think that family members such as grandparents will be better carers for their kids. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

**Answer**<br>
Some argue that when parents are at work, close relations provide the best care to young children, while others believe day care centres offer a better service. It is agreed that while some relatives take care of youngsters extremely well, childcare professionals offer a better overall service. This essay will first discuss the merits of family members looking after ‘pre-schoolers’, secondly, an analysis of childcare centres’ services, followed by a reasoned conclusion.

Many parents in full-time employment prefer to leave their young ones with grandparents and siblings when they are at work. This is often a trust issue, as the parents feel their child will be safer with someone from within the family nucleus. For example, a recent study showed that 62% of working mothers prefer a member of the immediate family to provide care when they are working. However, most kin are not trained childcare professionals and may not have the skills required to fully nurture a child.

Daycare centres may be a better option due to the fact that most of their staff are highly skilled professionals. Many of their staff are highly trained and have diplomas in child development. For instance, if you want a job in a Montessori school, they will insist that you are fully qualified, with many of their staff having degrees in early years development. In spite of this, there have been recent high-profile cases of abuse within these establishments which makes some parents wary.

In summary, although there are some issues involving trust, as long as parents vet each school properly, the high level of service provided by daycare professionals trumps that of unqualified family members.
