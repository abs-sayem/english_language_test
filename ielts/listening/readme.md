## **IELTS Listening Test**

### **Listening has some Major Issues** `(to me)`:
**`You have to`** -
- understand the words, tense and meaning
- focus on the question and the possible word(s) or option(s)
- the intervals between answers are not equal
- write the word(s) with correct spelling
<br>`all at the same time.`

**`What our limitations are`** -
- we cannot pay attention to different things at the same time.
- we cannot understand all the words they pronounce (the worst part is when the word we donâ€™t understand is the answer).
- when we cannot find an answer for an unusually long time, we panic, which affects the following questions.

**But we have Hopes:**
- most of the words and sentence structures will be familiar.
- answers will come sequentially.
- the sentences containing the answer word(s) will be grammatically correct, so we can verify our answers.

### **4 Sections - 40 Questions - 40 minutes `(30 minutes to hear audio + 10 minutes ot transfer answers)`**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Section 1 (Social) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Two Speakers** - A social (everyday) situation like - booking something in call.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Section 2 (Social) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One Speaker** - Also a social (everyday) situation like - a tour guide explaining guidelines or telling history of something or facilities of a hotel is offering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Section 3 (Academic) - Two or more Speakers** - An accademic discussion among 3-4 persons. Have to identify who is speaking and who is saying what.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Section 4 (Academic) - One Speaker** - An accademic lecture of one person

### **Tips**
- you hear the recording only once (we have to write the answer while listening, it could be little hard)
- write the answers either in CAPITAL LETTERS or in lower letters, you have to strict in one for all answers. (If use lower letters - still use Capital first letter for names, places).
- numbers of words for each answer: `No more than two words and/or a number` - one word / one number / two words / two words and a number
- all words and numbers are counted - a holiday (two words)
- spelling is important, misspelled words are wrong answers
- question types:
    - multiple choice
    - map completion
    - diagram labelling
    - form completion (common in section 1)
    - note completion (common in section 4)
    - flow chart completion
    - setence completion (very common)
    - summary completion
    - short answer questions
    - table completion
- don't try to understand everything, aim is to find answer
- prepare the questions and answers
- answers can come quickly, means - they don't follow equal intervals
- keep your eye on the next question
- make notes - since the questions could be large and you might forget them, write them shortly in note.
- there may be a gap between answers - it might the answer is comming later than usual.
- comman traps:
    - answer that are changed (seems like it is the answer but changed afterwards, so keep listening)
    - using similar words in question and recording rather their paraphrases, because ielts usually uses paraphases.
- repeated answers (usually in section 3, multiple speakers may repeat the answers)
- listen for plurals (most of the non-english speaker struggles to iderntify plurals)
- if you don't know the answer, guess and write an answer, don't leave empty
- Remember:
    - listen to the example given at the beginning
    - a range of accents will be used
    - look for titles (diagrams, maps, tables)
    - check where all the questions are
    - if you miss an answer, move quickly to the next one
    - accademic language in not always paraphrased (if you have any hard word it might not be useful)
- have to write words you hear, can't reform words
