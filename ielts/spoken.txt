Ans: Yes, My name is Md. Abu Bakar Siddiq Sayem. You can call me Sayem.

Q-2 : Where are you from?
Ans: I am from Laksam, a southurn metropoliton area in Cumilla city. It is like a terminal, connecting the south part with rest of the north and west part of Bangladesh in both railway and road.

Q-3 : Do you work or study?
Ans: I am currently working as a Software Engineer in R&D department at Alchemy Software Limited, a Chattogram based IT company. Also, I am pursuing my MSc. in CSE from IIUC, a promissing engineering university in Bangladesh. I did my BSc. from there as well.

Q-4 : What do you like about your job/studies?
Ans: My workplace is very interesting, especially because of my team. I work in Machine Learning, specifically in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's a fascinating and engaging field. Working in NLP is like teaching a system how to learn, similar to teaching a baby. 

Q-5 : What do you usually do in your free time?
Ans: I have a tight schedule with my 10-7 job, postgrad studies, and personal commitments, leaving me no free time except on weekends. Before heading home from the office, I sometimes stop by nearby shops to buy something or enjoy a light snack or tea. 

Q-6 : Do you enjoy cooking?
Ans: I used to enjoy cooking a lot. After my undergrad, I bought several kitchen utensils and started practicing because I found it interesting while living in the university hostel. However, after starting my job, my interest in cooking decreased, and now I only make my morning tea.

Q-7 : How often do you go shopping?
Ans: Shopping, especially for clothes, is difficult for me because I am very choosy. I often feel confused when making decisions, and itâ€™s even harder now with so many options available. I love shopping, but I hate the process of choosing.

Q-8 : What kind of music do you like?
Ans: I'm not a huge music lover, but I do enjoy soft, soothing music. It helps me relax and feels almost like meditation. I often listen to this kind of music when I'm doing something else, like writing, coding, or solving problems. I prefer it to be smooth and calming.

Q-9 : Do you like reading books?
Ans: I used to read a lot of academic books during school and college. But when I started university, I got a laptop and internet access. With so many courses and topics to cover, I preferred watching video tutorials instead of reading books. If I needed to read a book, I would look for a digital copy so I could read it on my phone anytime.

Q-18: How do you usually spend your weekends?
Ans : I have a one-day weekend, so planning something big is difficult. I usually wake up late and spend the first half of the day doing household chores. After the Friday prayer (Jumu'ah) and lunch, I take a nap. In the afternoon, I either go out with friends or visit a relative's house.

Q-19: Do you prefer living in a big city or a small town?
Ans : I have experience living in both a big city, like where I am now, and a small town, which was my hometown. Big cities usually have everything you need close by, but small towns are cleaner, have fresher air, more greenery, and playgrounds compared to big cities. If you have access to all the necessary things nearby, I prefer living in a small town.

Q-20: What is your favorite animal and why?
Ans : I am an animal lover, but I prefer to admire them from a distance. I like all domestic animals to some extent, but I find cats particularly appealing because they are gentle when they approach for food.
