***
**Can you tell me your full name, please?**<br>
**>** Yes, My name is Md. Abu Bakar Siddiq Sayem. You can call me Sayem.

**Where are you from?**<br>
**>** I am from Laksam, a southurn metropoliton area in Cumilla city. It is like a terminal, connecting the southern part with the rest of the northern and western parts of Bangladesh in both railway and road.

**Do you work or study?**<br>
**>** I am currently working as a Software Engineer in R&D department at Alchemy Software Limited, a Chattogram based IT company. Also, I am pursuing my MSc. in CSE from IIUC, a promissing engineering university in Bangladesh. I did my BSc. from there as well.

**What do you like about your job/studies?**<br>
**>** My workplace is very interesting, especially because of my team. I work in Machine Learning, more specifically in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's a fascinating and engaging field. Working in NLP is like teaching a system how to learn, similar to teaching a baby. 

**What do you usually do in your free time?**<br>
**>** I have a tight schedule with my 10-7 job, postgrad studies, and personal commitments, leaving me no free time except on weekends. Before heading home from the office, I sometimes stop by nearby shops to buy something or enjoy a light snack or tea. And once in a while, I go to the nearby cozy place and enjoy a relaxing time with one of my former roommates. 

**Do you enjoy cooking?**<br>
**>** I used to enjoy cooking a lot. After my undergrad, I bought several kitchen utensils and started practicing cooking because I found it interesting when I was in the varsity dormitory. However, after starting my job, my interest in cooking declined, and now I only make my breakfast occasionally.

**How often do you go shopping?**<br>
**>** Shopping, especially for clothes, is something I don’t do very often. It’s a bit difficult for me because I’m very choosy. I often feel confused when making decisions, and it’s even harder now with so many options available. However, I do shop for daily necessities frequently - almost every day, I buy something. I love shopping, but I hate the process of choosing.

**What kind of music do you like?**<br>
**>** I'm not a huge music lover, but I do enjoy soft, soothing music once in a while. It helps me relax and feels almost like meditation. I often listen to music when I'm doing something that doesn’t require much attention, like copy-pasting something, coding, or solving problems, or scrolling through social media. I prefer music to be smooth and calming.

**Do you like reading books?**<br>
**>** I used to read a lot of academic books when I was in school and college. But when I started university, I got a laptop and internet access. With so many courses and topics to cover, I preferred watching video tutorials instead of reading books. If I needed to read a book, I would look for a digital copy so I could read it on my phone anytime.

**How often do you exercise?**<br>
**>** I do simple warm-up exercises at home almost every day in the morning as soon as I wake up. I used to go outside to a nearby hill for almost a year but stopped after I got a fever that lasted three to four days. Now, I regularly do my home exercises, and very occasionally, I go to a nearby field in the evening after work. 

**What is your favorite season of the year?**<br>
**>** 

**Do you like watching movies?**<br>
**>**

**What is your favorite type of food?**<br>
**>**

**Do you use social media often?**<br>
**>**

**Have you ever been to a foreign country?**<br>
**>**

**Do you prefer spending time indoors or outdoors?**<br>
**>**

**What is your favorite hobby?**<br>
**>** When I was in school, I enjoyed collecting small plants and planting them at home, although most of them didn't survive. During my university years, I developed a passion for learning new things. I love discovering new technologies, inventions, nutrition facts, and economic insights.

**How do you usually spend your weekends?**<br>
**>** I have a one-day weekend, so planning something big is difficult. I usually wake up late and spend the first half of the day doing household chores. After the Friday prayer (Jumu'ah) and lunch, I take a nap. In the afternoon, I either go out with friends or visit a relative's house.

**Do you prefer living in a big city or a small town?**<br>
**>** I have experience living in both a big city, like where I am now, and a small town, which was my hometown. Big cities usually have everything you need close by, but small towns are cleaner, have fresher air, more greenery, and playgrounds compared to big cities. If you have access to all the necessary things nearby, I prefer living in a small town.

**What is your favorite animal and why?**<br>
**>** I am an animal lover, but I prefer to admire them from a distance. I like all domestic animals to some extent, but I find cats particularly appealing because they are gentle when they approach for food.
