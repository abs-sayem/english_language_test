## **IELTS Details**

### **Parts of IELTS Test**
1. **Reading**
2. **Listening**
3. **Writing**
4. **Speaking**

### **Know the Test Well**
- know the inside patterns of the parts (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking)
- know the marks distribution - which sub-part contains how much marks
- band score vs raw score - ?/9 : ?/40
- know the question patterns of the parts - what types of questions will be given and how the marks will be distributed
- For Example - for speaking the marks are distributed on 4 things:
	1. fluency and Coherence: Fluency is can I talk without having long pause and buzz words and Coherence is the relation between the sentences - are they related or we just jumps here and there.
	2. grammatical Range and Accuracy
	3. pronunciation
	4. lexical Resource - Vocabulary
- find out the strong and weak points and work on those
- practice, practice, practice
